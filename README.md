# Search GitHub Aplication

- This application was built as a code challenge for a job. The purpose of the application is for the user to be able to search a username to see users on GitHub that includes the names of the accounts with the searched username.
- *Where this is a sample application there is a limited number of calls that can be made to the API in an hour. You likely can only make three searches per hour!*
- Application is deployed with Netlify. https://main--singular-cranachan-64cc7e.netlify.app/

### Home Page
- You begin at this page. It has a form with an input box and a submit button. This is where the user can put the name they want to search.

### Users Page
- After the user has searched for a username, the top 30 users that match the given username are displayed on this screen. There are 10 pages, with 3 people per page. At the bottom there is pagination, which enables users to go between users.

- Each screen has a Navigation Bar as well as a footer. The NavBar is responsive to smaller screens and turns into a functioning hamburger menu. The footer on each page has links to my Twitter, GitHub, and LinkedIn that are functioning links.
